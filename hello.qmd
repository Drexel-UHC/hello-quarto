**Citations**

-   DOI: [@quistberg2018]
-   PubMed: [@Packer2021]

Cross references make it easier for readers to navigate your document by providing numbered references and hyperlinks to figures, tabs, equations and sections. For example we can reference @eq-lorenz. The number will automatically update when you change ordering so you don't have to!
