::: notes
So we've seen already how much Quarto enables with teach/collab/share. And now I want to push it a bit further. What if we could reimagine open science and open source as part of the how we work at the UHC or DSPH.

Culture shifts: <br> technical + human
:::

::: notes
We're talking about a **profound culture shift** that involves real deliberate work on the tech and human side

Let's focus on the human side: We can **build inclusion into our daily work**. Let's think about your team and collagues because I bet they're not different from the teams we mentor

This means **talking** and reflecting with your colleagues: how do we work? shared workflows, where is friction? who contributes, how do they contributes? Handoffs?

This means asking **questions** and really listening. might not have the language to describe where they're stuck. Not assuming, not solutioneering. But listening for understanding to meet them where they are

This means being **braver** to say I don't know, I need help

A practice, not a checklist. 

A practical example -

Fay Lab Manual is a site created by Gavin Fay's Group UMass D
They are quant fisheries ecologists: data and code: work with managers: food systems and climate
Bc formal training in data science is uncommon in env, range of skills incoming
This site: lab culture, code of conduct, info about how they name files, how to learn the software they use


It's a living doc online, and it's imperfect

It is radical in many ways, here are 3:

**Makes the implicit explicit** all be clear on how their group works together and it also puts the values forward and to welcome people who might be interested in joining the

**onboards learners as contributors** As you read the manual you're also instructed how to contribute. So it's through learning tools like Quarto to fix a typo that empowers learners in a lasting way.

**psychological safety & growth mindset** deliberately for example prioritzing time to check in during meetings and screensharing/live coding.

Reimagining within one lab and that idea is catching at bigger scales -

We forked this idea back
Here are 2 more examples: our Approach Guide which is how we onboard ourselves and others to grow the movement

::: notes
Quarto enables collaborating across coding comfort levels, which means it's a friendly tool
Also means we can broaden our idea of collaborators substantially and earlier.

And, then RStudio IDE Visual Editor further lowers barriers

I'll do one final demo here - Friendly for new learners, also for experienced users. 

Think about how you might use this yourself, and teach a colleague
